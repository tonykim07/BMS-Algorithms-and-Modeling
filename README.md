# BMS-Algorithms-and-Modeling

MATLAB Capstone projects for a 5 course specialization in Algorithms for Battery Management Systems.

The specialization covered the following topics: 
- The major functions that must be performed by a battery management system
- How lithium-ion battery cells work and how to model their behaviours mathematically
- Writing algorithms to estimate state-of-charge, state-of-health, remaining energy, and available power
- Cell Balancing
